# FIS4moire
This repository is to share FIS codes written and training image data used for the project on moiré fringe segmentation using fuzzy inference system.

> Project title: Moiré Fringe Segmentation Using Fuzzy Inference System 

The work is publised and available at https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-10-1721-6_27

The repo contains 3 uploads:
1. fuzzytestrealcircular3 - codes written for the testing in the work. Simply click two locations in image for segmentation. 
2. car2polar - a simple plan transformation algorithm to transform image in cartesian plane to polar-radius plane
3. Input_img&train_data - contain training images and target data (location of moiré fringes in image)
